# Challenge 3 ----

# Based on the output of str(stops) can you answer the following questions?
#   
#   What is the class of the object stops?
#   How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
#   How many counties have been recorded in this dataset?



# Indexing and subsetting data frames ---- 

stops[1, 1]   # first element in the first column of the data frame (as a vector)
stops[1, 6]   # first element in the 6th column (as a vector)
stops[, 1]    # first column in the data frame (as a vector)
stops[1]      # first column in the data frame (as a data.frame)
stops[1:3, 7] # first three elements in the 7th column (as a vector)
stops[3, ]    # the 3rd row (as a data.frame)
stops[1:6, ]  # the 1st to 6th rows, equivalent to head(stops)
stops[, -1]           # the whole data frame, excluding the first column
stops[-c(7:211211),]  # equivalent to head(stops)




stops["violation_raw"]       # Result is a data.frame
stops[, "violation_raw"]     # Result is a vector
stops[["violation_raw"]]     # Result is a vector
stops$violation_raw          # Result is a vector



# Challenge 4 ----

# Create a data.frame (stops_200) containing only the observations from row 200 of the stops dataset.
# 
# Notice how nrow() gave you the number of rows in a data.frame?
#   
# Use that number to pull out just that last row in the data frame.
# Compare that with what you see as the last row using tail() to make sure itâ€™s meeting expectations.
# Pull out that last row using nrow() instead of the row number.
# Create a new data frame object (stops_last) from that last row.
# Use nrow() to extract the row that is in the middle of the data frame. Store the content of this row in an object named trafficstops_middle.





# Conditional Subsetting ----


# the condition:
# returns a logical vector of the length of the column
stops$county_name == "Webster County" 

# use this vector to extract rows and all columns
# note the comma: we want *all* columns
stops[stops$county_name == "Webster County", ] 

# assign extract to a new data frame
webster_stops <- stops[stops$county_name == "Webster County", ]

# and if we wanted to see the breakdown by race:
table(webster_stops$driver_race)



# Challenge 5 ----
# Use subsetting to extract trafficstops in Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson Counties into a separate data frame coastal_counties.
# Using coastal_counties, count the number of Black and White drivers in the three counties.
# 


# Adding and removing rows and columns

new_col <- row.names(stops)
stops_withnewcol <- cbind(stops, new_col)

# adding row with rbind

                      county_name="Tallahatchie County", county_fips=12345,                      police_department="MSHP", driver_gender="F", driver_birthdate="1999-06-14",

as.numeric(f)               # wrong! and there is no warning...
as.numeric(as.character(f)) # works...
as.numeric(levels(f))[f]    # The recommended way.

# Dates ----

str(stops)


library(lubridate)

stop_date <- ymd(stops$stop_date)
str(stop_date) # notice the 'date' class

plot(factor(year(stop_date)))




# Quick Introduction to the Tidyverse ----

#library(tidyverse)

# the dplyr way to do the same thing

  filter(county_name == "Webster County")

webster_stops_dplyr <- stops %>% 
  filter(county_name == "Webster County") %>% 
  select(county_name, starts_with("driver"))



# Challenge 6 ----

# load the dplyr library
# create a new data frame using dplyr containing only "Simpson County" 
# and the variables 'stop_date', 'county_fips', and 'violation_raw'
# how many observations did you get?
#
# what happens when you flip the order of filter() and select()?
